# MyBarber Appointment System

## Overview

The Appointment Management System is a web-based application developed using **Java, JSP and MySQL**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**.

This system was designed to replace manual appointment booking methods with a centralized and database-driven platform. It improves operational efficiency, reduces scheduling conflicts and enhances the customer booking experience.

The system supports three primary roles :
- **Administrator**
- **Staff (Barber)**
- **Customer**
