# MyBarber Appointment Management System

## 📌 Overview

The Appointment Management System is a web-based application developed using **Java, JSP, and MySQL**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**.

This system was designed to replace manual appointment booking methods with a centralized and database-driven platform. It improves operational efficiency, reduces scheduling conflicts, and enhances the customer booking experience.

The system supports three primary roles:
- **Administrator**
- **Staff (Barber)**
- **Customer**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Digitize manual appointment booking processes
- Prevent double booking and scheduling conflicts
- Enable customers to select preferred barbers
- Provide real-time appointment tracking
- Improve overall business workflow management

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system follows the **MVC architectural pattern**:

- **Model** → Java classes handling business logic and database operations  
- **View** → JSP pages for user interface rendering  
- **Controller** → Servlets managing request handling and workflow  
- **Database** → MySQL for structured data storage  

This structure ensures:
- Better code organization
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Separation of concerns
